Exercise 7: List Comprehensions

Letâ€™s say I give you a list saved in a variable:
a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. Write one line of
Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has
only the even elements of this list in it.

'''

# Solution
a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
print([i for i in a if i % 2 == 0])
