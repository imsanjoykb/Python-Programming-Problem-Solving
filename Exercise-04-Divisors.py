Exercise 4: Divisors 

Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out
a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a
divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number.
For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

'''

# Solution
number = int(input("Please input a number:"))
divisors = [i for i in range(1, number+1) if number % i == 0]

print("Divisor(s):")
print(divisors)
